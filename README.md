## 04 - Coding-Whiz-Quiz

Week 4's Web API Challenge is to use everything we've learned so far to create a timed quiz with locally stored scores that display on a highscore page.

The quiz is hosted by GitHub pages and can be found at: https://acst52.github.io/Coding-Whiz-Quiz/


### Acceptance Criteria

Regarding the acceptance criteria,
  1. When user clicks start, the quiz timer begins counting down and the first question is displayed.
  2. When the user answers a question, the next question is displayed.
  3. If the user answers a question incorrectly, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer.
  4. When all questions are answered (or timer reaches 0), the quiz ends and the user's score is displayed. 
  5. The user can enter their initials and see their score appear on a highscore page, with all scores scrolling in decending order.
